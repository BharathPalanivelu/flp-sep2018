Exercise1: 
Write a class Worker and derive classes DailyWorker and
SalariedWorker from it. Every worker has a name and a salary rate. Write method
ComPay (int hours) to compute the week pay of every worker. A Daily Worker is
paid on the basis of the number of days s/he works. The Salaried Worker gets paid
the wage for 40 hours a week no matter what the actual hours are. Test this program
to calculate the pay of workers. You are expected to use the concept of polymorphism
to write this program.


Exercise2: 
Consider the trunk calls of a telephone exchange. A trunk call can be
ordinary, urgent or lightning. The charges depend on the duration and the type of the
call. Writ a program using the concept of polymorphism in Java to calculate the
charges.
